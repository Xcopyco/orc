### Quick Start

Pull the [image from Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/orcproject/orc/).

```
docker pull orcproject/orc
```

Create a data directory on the host.

```
mkdir path/to/orc.data
```

Run the ORC container and mount the data directory.

```
docker run -v path/to/orc.data:/root/.config/orc -t orcproject/orc:latest
```

Modify the created configuration at `path/to/orc.data/config` as desired (see 
[the configuration docs](https://github.com/orcproject/orc/blob/master/doc/config.md))
and restart the container for the changes to take effect. You might wish to 
expose the ports defined for `ControlPort` and `BridgePort` to the host (and 
update `ControlHostname` and `BridgeHostname` to `0.0.0.0`) and map them to the 
host.

```
docker run \
  --publish 127.0.0.1:4444:4444 \
  --publish 127.0.0.1:4445:4445 \
  --expose 4444 \
  --expose 4445 \
  --volume path/to/orc.data:/root/.config/orc \
  --tty orcproject/orc:latest
```

See the [`docker run` documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) 
for more information. If you prefer to install ORC manually, see the guide for 
{@tutorial install}. Once installed, simply run `orc` with an optional 
configuration file using the `--config <path/to/config>` option. See the 
{@tutorial config} for details on the format and accepted properties.
